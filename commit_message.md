refactor(repo): Move config files to root and update commit message workflow

- Moved `COMMIT_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE.md` and `README.md` from `.config/` to the repository root for better visibility and accessibility.
- Updated the commit message workflow by introducing a dedicated `commit_message.md` file in the root, which will be used to draft commit messages.
- Removed the old `.config/commit_message.md` as it is no longer needed.
